Notes/Known Problems:
- Ultranest doesn't run with EDGES data (AssertionError) - Jonathan suggest slice mode. (Still need to test with ARES)
- Nestle doesn't run (Nan/Inf Error)
- Can't install PyPolychord


To do generally:
- Integrate PyGDSM
- Run EDGES with Bowman/Hills models on HPC with high livepoints to reproduce good data for report.
- Run ARES simulated data with ARES models on HPC with high livepoints to get good data for report.


To do in 'sampler.py':
- Add more controls over samplers (e.g. slice, unif etc.)
- Timer for samplers, full run and ARES simulation. Save results.
- Test some Mock Data runs with various samplers
- Generalise/modularise Likelihood types selection and add a control.
- Add control for treating the error as a parameter or not.
- Add control for s.f. of parameters on contour plots.

To do in 'edges.py': 
- Make EDGES reproduced data plots prettier so can be used in the report.
- Improve the thermal noise function so that it can be used more accurately.

To do in 'plotting.py:
- Re-design directory/path of file and outputs.
- Integrate into sampler.py so that running sampler.py will run plotting.py and produce associated plots
- Makes plots prettier so can be used in the report.

To do in 'models.py':
- Add other Hills models
- Refashioning into class structure might be better (lot of effort though)

To do in 'ares_sim.py':
- Add more simulations for different papers/model examples.
- Re-design where the simulation plots it's data.
- Re-design the plot so that it's prettier.
